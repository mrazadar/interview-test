### Why are you choosing this particular sample? Why are you proud of it?

  I am choosing this because this test demonstrate certain espects of my development skills, like 'UI form handling', 'Depth first search algorithm (recursive approach)', Communication with the server.  




### What was the problem you had to solve by writing it?
 
 All the problems mentioned in the shared document. 


### How does it work?

  For server please follow the steps below. 
  For client Just run the index.HTML file in the root directory directly in your browser or you can use any webserver. 


### A brief description/representation of the architecture

  I believe this is the very basic test which only describe basics of javascripts. 
  For better architecture I use https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate
  Please have a look on www.xiangqi.com for my most recent work in production.
